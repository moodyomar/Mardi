            <strong>Mardi Gras in New Orleans<br> </strong>is the holiday of that is celebrated in all of Louisiana,
            including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through
            Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition).

            Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The
            largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final
            week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls.<br>

            <strong>The parades in New Orleans</strong><br> are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow
            the same parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of
            Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are
            well known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for
            naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming
            celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American
            krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of
            colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys,
            but throws can also include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and
            route each year.
