<!-- So hovering obviously dont work in mobile only desktop. 

!IMPORTANT
--- please pay attention that I have hovers on sponsors only in desktop to show title and if you start the website in desktop then drag the edges all the way to the mobile view it won't work without a refresh ,same as from mobile to desktop caused by my IF statment on the viewport width.
and obviously mobile user cant open my site in his mobile and actually stretch the screen to 1200px (desktop view) ...

--- I Focused mainly on 414 width: iphone 6/7/8 Plus and up.
but its responsive even from 360.

Enjoy it! 
you dear Moody :D
